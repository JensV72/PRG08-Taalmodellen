Should any one wish to\r\nmake the dishes richer, it can easily be done by an addition of\r\nbutter, eggs, or cream.\r\n\r\nLet me draw the attention of vegetarians to the use of soaked sago in\r\nmany dishes. This is a farinaceous food which should be used much more\r\nlargely in vegetarian cookery than it is. Thoroughly soaked sago\r\nshould be used in all dishes, savouries or sweets, in which a\r\nsubstitute for suet is required to lighten the mixture; that is, in\r\nboiled savouries or sweets which are largely made of wholemeal, as,\r\nfor instance, in vegetable haggis, roly-poly pudding, and all fruit or\r\nvegetable puddings which are boiled in a paste.

In breads and cakes I have used a small\r\nquantity of yeast for the rising of the dough; those who once have got\r\naccustomed to the use of yeast will not find it any more trouble than\r\nusing baking powder. It may here be beneficial to give a few hints as\r\nto the harm done by the use of the most commonly introduced chemicals,\r\nnamely, soda, bicarbonate of soda, baking powder, tartaric acid, and\r\ncitric acid.

Another danger lies in the fact that\r\nthese chemicals are too dear to be supplied pure to the public, which\r\nalways demands cheap goods, and the result is that many of the\r\nchemicals in the market are mixed with other still worse poisons, like\r\narsenic, for instance. Self-raising flour, which is liked by so many\r\non account of its convenience, is nothing but ordinary flour mixed\r\nwith some sort of baking powder; in the same way egg powders are\r\nsimply starch powders, coloured and flavoured, mixed with baking\r\npowder. Tartaric acid and citric acid also belong to the class of\r\ninjurious chemicals. They are often used in the making of acid drinks,\r\nwhen lemons are not handy.

The results to persons of sedentary habits of eating pulse\r\nfoods often are indigestion, heavy and dull feelings, and general\r\ndiscomfort.

When the\r\ngreens are tender, any water which is not absorbed should be thickened\r\nwith a little Allinson fine wheatmeal and eaten with the vegetables. A\r\ngreat number of them, such as _Cabbages, Savoys, Brussel sprouts,\r\nScotch kail, turnip-tops, &c., &c._, can be prepared this way.\r\n\r\nIn the case of vegetables like _asparagus, cauliflower, sea kale,\r\nparsnips, artichokes, carrots_ or _celery_, which cannot always be\r\nstewed in a little water, this should be saved as stock for soups or\r\nsauces.

Barley has been used as a food from\r\ntime out of mind. We find frequent mention of it in the Bible, and in\r\nold Latin and Greek books. According to Pliny, an ancient Roman\r\nwriter, the gladiators were called Hordearii, or \"barley eaters,\"\r\nbecause they were fed on this grain whilst training. These Hordearii\r\nwere like our pugilists, except that they often fought to the death.\r\nBarley has been used from very ancient days for making an intoxicating\r\ndrink.

Hops were not used for beer or ale in those days.\r\nBarley is a good food, and was the chief food of our peasantry until\r\nthe beginning of the nineteenth century. Barley contains about 7 per\r\ncent. of sugar, and its flesh-forming matter is in the form of casin\r\nthe same as is found in cheese. This casin is not elastic like the\r\ngluten of wheat, so that one cannot make a light bread from barley.\r\nHere is the chemical composition of barley meal:--\r\n\r\n  Flesh formers                        7.5\r\n  Heat and force formers (carbon)[A]  76.0\r\n  Mineral matters                      2.0\r\n  Water                               14.5\r\n                                     -----\r\n                                     100.0\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: There is 2.5 per cent. of fat in barley, and 7 per cent.\r\nof sugar.]","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":8403,"to":8422}}}}],["b459e779-1695-44b7-bffe-d4a34726a072",{"pageContent":"-----\r\n                                     100.0\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: There is 2.5 per cent. of fat in barley, and 7 per cent.\r\nof sugar.]\r\n\r\nFrom this analysis we can judge that barley contains all the\r\nconstituents of a good food.
